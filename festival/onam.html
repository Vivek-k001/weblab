        Onam is the biggest festival in Kerala, celebrated with joy and enthusiasm by people of all communities. 
        It marks the homecoming of King Mahabali. Festivities include Pookalam (flower decorations), Onasadya 
        (traditional feast), Vallamkali (snake boat race), and traditional dances. The festival usually falls in the 
        Malayalam month of Chingam (August-September) and lasts for ten days, with each day having its own significance. 
        Homes are decorated with intricate floral carpets, and people wear new clothes called 'Onakkodi'. The highlight 
        of Onam is the grand feast known as Onasadya, served on banana leaves with a variety of delicious vegetarian dishes. 
        Cultural programs, games, and music add to the festive spirit, making Onam a vibrant and memorable celebration 
        that brings families and communities together.
