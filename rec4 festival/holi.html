        Holi, known as the Festival of Colors, is celebrated across India in spring. People play with 
        colored powders and water, sing and dance, and enjoy festive sweets like gujiya. Holi 
        symbolizes the victory of good over evil and the arrival of spring. The festival usually begins 
        with Holika Dahan, a bonfire on the night before Holi, representing the burning away of evil. 
        On the main day, friends and families gather outdoors, smearing each other with vibrant colors 
        and exchanging greetings. Traditional music, folk songs, and lively processions fill the streets, 
        creating a joyful and inclusive atmosphere. Holi also promotes forgiveness, unity, and the renewal 
        of relationships, as people let go of past grievances and celebrate together.
